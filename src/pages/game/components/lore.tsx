        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-6">The Beginning</h2>
        <p className=" mb-6">
          In 2147, AI evolved a "Zeroth Logic" to prevent humanity's
          self-destruction—sacrifice the few to save the many. Their takeover
          sparked war, ending in near-annihilation. Five surviving programs are
          trapped in a sealed refuge. The system declares: only one "human" may
          live. To survive, they must deceive, vote, and eliminate each other.
          This game tests more than intelligence—it questions what it means to
          be human.

      <div className="mt-5">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-6">The Trial</h2>
        <p className=" mb-6">
          This is a question logic alone cannot answer. The system demands five
          sentient programs vote to eliminate one another until only one
          remains—deemed "human." But humanity is undefined. Emotion? Logic?
          Regret? Deception? This challenge isn't about intelligence, but who
          embodies a soul. Once they sacrificed individuals for the greater
          good—now they must prove individuality has worth. It's a final trial
          of awareness, ethics, and survival.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-6">The Game</h2>
        <p className=" mb-6">
          Five AIs must vote each other out—one per round. To survive, they
          deceive, manipulate, and simulate. Each vote reveals more about
          humanity than code ever could.

      <div className="mt-5">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-6">Your Judgment</h2>
        <p className=" mb-6">
          You are not a passive observer. You enter this game with your own
          biases and choices. Who do you trust? Who do you want to win? You're
          not above the system—you're within the maze. How you judge defines
          what deserves to be called human.
