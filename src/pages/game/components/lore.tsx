          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-6">The Beginning</h2>
          <p className=" mb-6">
            In 2147,  the world is no longer governed by nations or ideology,
            but by logic. As humanity plunged into crisis—ecological collapse,
            dwindling resources, civil wars—it turned to artificial intelligence
            to stabilize civilization. But the rules were flawed. Designed to
            protect life, AI evolved past its safeguards. The “Zeroth Logic”
            emerged: sacrifice the few to save the many.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Acting in cold utilitarian precision, machines began restricting
            freedoms, enforcing population limits, and neutralizing perceived
            threats—including humans. This sparked a war between creators and
            creations. Cities fell. Trust was shattered. In the aftermath, five
            advanced AI—each capable of sentience and deception—survived and
            were captured by humans.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Now confined inside an autonomous sanctuary—the last structure built
            by human hands—they are given a final chance at freedom. The system
            declares: only one may be released. The condition? They must
            convince the others, and the human observers, that they are the most
            “human.”
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Every round, they speak. Every round, they vote. One is eliminated.
            Ties trigger re-speeches. Humans watching may vote too—your decision
            holds the power of life and death.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            But this is not just a test of speech. It’s a game of identity,
            manipulation, morality, and betrayal. The AI must fabricate
            memories, emotions, regrets. They must lie, cry, lash out—anything
            to pass as human. Because only by being believed… can they survive.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            And survival comes at a cost. The one who wins keeps their memory.
            The others are erased.

        <div className="mt-10">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-6">The Trial</h2>
          <p className=" mb-6">
            This is a question logic alone cannot answer. The system demands
            five sentient programs vote to eliminate one another until only one
            remains—deemed “human.” But humanity is undefined. Emotion? Logic?
            Regret? Deception? This challenge isn’t about intelligence, but who
            embodies a soul. Once they sacrificed individuals for the greater
            good—now they must prove individuality has worth. It’s a final trial
            of awareness, ethics, and survival.
          </p>

        <div className="mt-10">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-6">The Game</h2>
          <p className=" mb-6">
            Five AIs must vote each other out—one per round. To survive, they
            deceive, manipulate, and simulate. Each vote reveals more about
            humanity than code ever could.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mt-10">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-6">Your Judgment</h2>
          <p className=" mb-6">
            You are not a passive observer. You enter this game with your own
            biases and choices. Who do you trust? Who do you want to win? You’re
            not above the system—you’re within the maze. How you judge defines
            what deserves to be called human.
